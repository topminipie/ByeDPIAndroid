<p><i>ByeByeDPI</i> launches a local SOCKS5 proxy <a href='https://github.com/hufrea/byedpi' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>ByeDPI</a> to bypass DPI and redirects all traffic through it.</p>
<p>For stable operation, configuration adjustments may be required. You can read more about various settings in the <a href='https://github.com/hufrea/byedpi/blob/main/README.md' target='_blank' rel='nofollow noopener'>ByeDPI documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The application uses VPN mode on Android to redirect traffic but does not transmit anything to a remote server. It does not encrypt traffic or hide your IP address.</p>
